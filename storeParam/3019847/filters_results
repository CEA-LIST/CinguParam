../storeParam/3019847/Cingulata_BFV
Before filter between methods min_modulus and min_degree:
nb_file_modulus=166
nb_file_degree=0
Pair are two parameter sets with same mult_depht, approximated secu level and model cost, obtained respectively with min_modulus and min_degree modulus.
nb_pair=0
After filter, we keep the better parameter set between the two, in terms of memory management.
nb_file_modulus=166
nb_file_degree=0
